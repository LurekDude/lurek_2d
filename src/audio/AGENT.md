## Summary

The audio module wraps the `rodio` cross-platform audio library into a
game-oriented mixing layer, handling every stage of game audio from file
loading to final output.  It decodes sound files (WAV, OGG Vorbis, FLAC, MP3)
into static in-memory sources or streaming sources, controls per-source
playback state (volume, pitch, looping, fade in/out), routes sources through
named audio buses for grouped volume control (for example a dedicated "sfx"
bus and a "music" bus), and applies simple DSP effects (low-pass and
high-pass filtering) as rodio source wrappers.

Each active sound is stored as an `AudioEntry` in a `SlotMap<SoundKey>`.  The
`Mixer` owns the underlying `rodio::OutputStream` and manages the lifecycle
of all `rodio::Sink` handles; a poll on every frame reaps finished sinks and
keeps the active-source count bounded.  Spatial audio is approximated for 2D
games: panning is derived from the horizontal offset between a sound's world
position and the listener position, mapped to a stereo split via a linear
panning law.

A `MidiPlayer` provides synthesised music playback: MIDI events are parsed
with `midly` and rendered to PCM at 44 100 Hz using additive sine synthesis,
supporting per-channel mute, independent volume control on each track, and
real-time tempo changes encoded in the MIDI file.
