//! Finite State Machine with priority-ordered guarded transitions.
//!
//! The FSM is a classic game AI pattern: the agent is in exactly one named state
//! at a time. Each state has optional Lua lifecycle callbacks (`on_enter`,
//! `on_update`, `on_exit`). Transitions between states are guarded by optional
//! Lua predicates and ordered by descending priority.
//!
//! ## Update Cycle
//!
//! During each `AIWorld::update(dt)` tick for an agent with `DecisionModel::Fsm`:
//!
//! 1. All transitions from the current state are checked in descending priority
//!    order. The first transition whose guard returns `true` (or has no guard)
//!    fires.
//! 2. If a transition fires: the current state's `on_exit` is called, the
//!    current state switches, `time_in_state` resets to 0, and the new state's
//!    `on_enter` is called.
//! 3. The current state's `on_update(dt)` is called.
//!
//! ## Priority Ordering
//!
//! Transitions are stored sorted by descending priority. When multiple transitions
//! from the same source state could fire, the highest-priority one wins. This
//! allows "panic" transitions (e.g., health < 10% → flee) to override normal
//! patrol logic without complex guard nesting.
