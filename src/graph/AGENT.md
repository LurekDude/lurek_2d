## Purpose

The graph module provides a general-purpose directed weighted graph with item flow simulation, Dijkstra pathfinding, and a classical algorithm suite. It is a Tier 2 engine extension that depends only on Baseline (`math`, `engine`) and no Tier 1 modules. Game developers use it whenever their data is naturally relational rather than spatial: dialogue trees where nodes are lines and edges are player choices, quest dependency systems where completing a quest unlocks others, skill trees, resource production pipelines, logistics networks, and dungeon layout validation.
