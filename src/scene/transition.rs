//! Visual transition types, easing curves, and active transition state for scene changes.
//!
//! This module is part of Lurek2D's `scene` subsystem and provides the implementation
//! details for transition-related operations, including easing curves.
//! Key types exported from this module: `TransitionType`, `EasingType`, `ActiveTransition`.
//! Primary functions: `from_lua_str()`, `new()`, `new_with_easing()`, `progress()`,
//! `progress_eased()`, `is_complete()`.
//!
//! # Easing
//! `EasingType` provides six standard curves (Linear, EaseIn, EaseOut, EaseInOut, Bounce,
//! Back).  The raw linear `progress()` value and the easing-adjusted `progress_eased()`
//! value are both available on `ActiveTransition`.
//!
//! All public items are documented. See the parent module for architectural context
//! and the `lurek.*` Lua API for the scripting interface.
